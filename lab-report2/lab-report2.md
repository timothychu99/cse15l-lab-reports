## Timothy Chu
* No bugs for all the test-files passed for my Markdown.java file
* so I made my own test files

* failure-inducing input: [test-file9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timothychu99/markdown-parse/main/test-file9.md)
* fail output: ![ssss](test-file9_fail.png)


* Show a screenshot of the code change diff from Github (a page like this)
* Link to the test file for a failure-inducing input that prompted you to make that change
* Show the symptom of that failure-inducing input by showing the output of running the file at the command line for the version where it was failing (this * should also be in the commit message history)
* Write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.
