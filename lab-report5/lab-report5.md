## How I Found Tests with Diff Results


Explain:

How you found the tests with different results (Did you use diff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)
For each test:
Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the _bug (the problem in the code). You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed.
